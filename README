Graphics Pipeline implemented in C [Model-View-Projection-Viewport]


* Main.cpp [Compiled to ./main] and alternate.cpp [Compiled to ./alternate] are two examples, using sgl.h library. The .h file also contains all the definitions.

*** Alternate.cpp borrowed from DC++ (couldn't write a decent example in time).

Main function should begin with 
	
	init();

Suggested Projection/Viewport matrix parameters are (these functions should be called right after init):

	sglViewport(0, 0, 400, 400);
        sglProjFrustum(-0.1,0.1, -0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 100) or sglOrthoProj(a,b,c,d,e,f);

IMPORTANT - THIS LINE IS REQUIRED RIGHT AFTER INIT:
	
	sglStack.PushMatrix(viewMatrix);

The drawScene function should begin with

	sglModLoadIdentity();
        sglViewLoadIdentity();
	
and end with
	
	sglShow();

A PLY file by the name of plyFile.txt will be generated.
